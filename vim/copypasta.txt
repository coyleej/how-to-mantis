Hey folks, just got a few dozen messages complaining about the influx of upvote begging posts on my way to secure my second multi-billion deal this week for a global conglomerate. Now I don't like interruptions on my private jets when flying to make said deals in the far reaches of the globe but this matter is clearly very important and I would like to address it head on.

Posts that fall under "For every upvote I will ____" and other upvote begging posts will be removed as they are not copypasta and redditors who post them will be temporarily banned going forward.

That kind of content is not copypasta or original and belongs more on subreddits like /r/circlejerk or /r/braveryjerk. Upvote begging posts have ruined many a subreddits that you show your friends and then nervously laugh while reassuring them that the sub was better way back in the day as they look on in disgust.

Here are some examples of low quality posts that were made today. (Each word is a clickable link!) And the a sample of the complaints not to mention over 58 reports.

During my numerous business dealings with leaders of major countries I like to read the newest meemee pasta on my $2,500 phone and it's a real owchie when there are none just so Kevin can get his latest karma hit. Yeah, that Kevin who sprinkles emojis on stale copypasta and serves it to the wide-eyed innocent /r/copypasta subscribers who don't know any better. The same subscribers that later become jaded, spam subs with low-effort karmagrabs themselves and lie to their dentist claiming that they "floss all the time, I swear" when they are actually referring to the dance craze from the popular real time strategy game Forteen-Nights™.

tl;dr post more copypasta, less garbage

"I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for ransom I can tell you I don't have money, but what I do have are a very particular set of skills. Skills I have acquired over a very long career. Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you. If you let my daughter go now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you, but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will kill you."
—Liam Neeson, Taken

So I (74M) was recently hit by a car (2014 Honda) and died. My wife (5F) organized me a funeral (cost $2747) without asking me (74M) at all. I (74M) was unable to make it because I (74M) was dead (17 days). At the funeral I heard my dad (15M) and other family members talking about how they wish I could be there and now I feel bad for not showing up. AITA?

Edit: u/RadGlitch (6 years old) and an anonymous Reddit user are NTA for giving me gold (500 Reddit coins) and platinum (1800 Reddit coins)
